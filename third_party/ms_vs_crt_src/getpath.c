/***
*_getpath() - extract a pathname from a semicolon-delimited list of pathnames
*
*Purpose:
*       To extract the next pathname from a semicolon-delimited list of
*       pathnames (usually the value on an environment variable) and copy
*       it to a caller-specified buffer. No check is done to see if the path
*       is valid. The maximum number of characters copied to the buffer is
*       maxlen - 1 (and then a '\0' is appended).
*
*ifdef _HPFS_
*       If we hit a quoted string, then allow any characters inside.
*       For example, to put a semi-colon in a path, the user could have
*       an environment variable that looks like:
*
*               PATH=C:\BIN;"D:\CRT\TOOLS;B1";C:\BINP
*endif
*
*       NOTE: Semi-colons in sequence are skipped over; pointers to 0-length
*       pathnames are NOT returned (this includes leading semi-colons).
*
*       NOTE: If this routine is made user-callable, the near attribute
*       must be replaced by _LOAD_DS and the prototype moved from INTERNAL.H
*       to STDLIB.H. The source files MISC\SEARCHEN.C and EXEC\SPAWNVPE.C
*       will need to be recompiled, but should not require any changes.
*
*Entry:
*       src    - Pointer to a string of 0 or more path specificiations,
*                delimited by semicolons (';'), and terminated by a null
*                character
*       dst    - Pointer to the buffer where the next path specification is to
*                be copied
*       maxlen - Maximum number of characters to be copied, counting the
*                terminating null character. Note that a value of 0 is treated
*                as UINT_MAX + 1.
*
*Exit:
*       If a pathname is successfully extracted and copied, a pointer to the
*       first character of next pathname is returned (intervening semicolons
*       are skipped over). If the pathname is too long, as much as possible
*       is copied to the user-specified buffer and NULL is returned.
*
*       Note that the no check is made of the validity of the copied pathname.
*
*Exceptions:
