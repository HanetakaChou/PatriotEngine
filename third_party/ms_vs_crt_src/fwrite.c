/***
*size_t fwrite(void *buffer, size_t size, size_t count, FILE *stream) -
*       write to the specified stream from the specified buffer.
*
*Purpose:
*       Write 'count' items of size 'size' to the specified stream from
*       the specified buffer. Return when 'count' items have been written
*       or no more items can be written to the stream.
*
*Entry:
*       buffer  - pointer to user's buffer
*       size    - size of the item to write
*       count   - number of items to write
*       stream  - stream to write to
*
*Exit:
*       Returns the number of (whole) items that were written to the stream.
*       This may be less than 'count' if an error or eof occurred. In this
*       case, ferror() or feof() should be used to distinguish between the
*       two conditions.
*
*Notes:
*       fwrite will attempt to buffer the stream (side effect of the _flsbuf
*       call) if necessary.
*
*       No more than 0xFFFE bytes may be written out at a time by a call to
*       write(). Further, write() does not handle huge buffers. Therefore,
*       in large data models, the write request is broken down into chunks
*       that do not violate these considerations. Each of these chunks is
*       processed much like an fwrite() call in a small data model (by a
*       call to _nfwrite()).
*
*       This code depends on _iob[] being a near array.
*
*       MTHREAD/DLL - Handled in just two layers since it is small data
*       model. The outer layer, fwrite(), handles stream locking/unlocking
*       and calls _fwrite_nolock() to do the work. _fwrite_nolock() is the same as
*       the single-thread, small data model version of fwrite().
