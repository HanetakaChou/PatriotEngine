*crtdll.c - CRT initialization for a DLL using the MSVCRT* model of C run-time
*
*       Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
*
*Purpose:
*       This module contains the initialization entry point for the C run-time
*       stub in this DLL.  All C run-time code is located in the C Run-Time
*       Library DLL "MSVCRT*.DLL", except for a little bit of start-up code in
*       the EXE, and this code in each DLL.  This code is necessary to invoke
*       the C++ constructors for the C++ code in this DLL.
*
*       This entry point should either be specified as the DLL initialization
*       entry point, or else it must be called by the DLL initialization entry
*       point of the DLL with the same arguments that the entry point receives.
