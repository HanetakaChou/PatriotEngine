*_mtinitlocks() - Initialize multi-thread lock scheme
*
*Purpose:
*       Perform whatever initialization is required for the multi-thread
*       locking (synchronization) scheme. This routine should be called
*       exactly once, during startup, and this must be before any requests
*       are made to assert locks.
*
*       NOTES: In Win32, the multi-thread locks are created individually,
*       each upon its first use. That is when any particular lock is asserted
*       for the first time, the underlying critical section is then allocated,
*       initialized and (finally) entered. This allocation and initialization
*       is protected under _LOCKTAB_LOCK. It is _mtinitlocks' job to set up
*       _LOCKTAB_LOCK.
*
*       All other named (non-FILE) locks are also preallocated in _mtinitlocks.
*       That is because a failure to allocate a lock on its first use in _lock
*       triggers a fatal error, which cannot be permitted since that can bring
*       down a long-lived app without warning.
*
*Entry:
*       <none>
*
*Exit:
*       returns FALSE on failure
