*       This object goes into LIBC.LIB and LIBCMT.LIB and MSVCRT.LIB for use
*       when linking a DLL with one of the three models of C run-time library.
*       If the user does not provide a DllMain notification routine, this
*       dummy handler will be linked in.  It always returns TRUE (success).

*DllMain - dummy version DLLs linked with all 3 C Run-Time Library models
*
*Purpose:
*       The routine DllMain is always called by _DllMainCrtStartup.  If
*       the user does not provide a routine named DllMain, this one will
*       get linked in so that _DllMainCRTStartup has something to call.
*
*       For the LIBC.LIB and MSVCRT.LIB models, the CRTL does not need
*       per-thread notifications so if the user is ignoring them (default
*       DllMain and _pRawDllMain == NULL), just turn them off.  (WIN32-only)
*
*Entry:

*Exit:

*Exceptions:
