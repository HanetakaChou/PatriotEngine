*struct tm *_localtime64_s(ptm, ptime) - convert __time64_t value to tm structure
*
*Purpose:
*       Convert a value in 64-bit internal (__time64_t) format to a tm struct
*       containing the corresponding local time.
*
* NOTES:
*       (1) gmtime must be called before _isindst to ensure that the tb time
*           structure is initialized.
*       (2) gmtime, _gtime64, localtime and _localtime64() all use a single
*           statically allocated buffer. Each call to one of these routines
*           destroys the contents of the previous call.
*       (3) It is assumed that __time64_t is a 64-bit integer representing
*           the number of seconds since 00:00:00, 01-01-70 (UTC) (i.e., the
*           Posix/Unix Epoch. Only non-negative values are supported.
*       (4) It is assumed that the maximum adjustment for local time is
*           less than three days (include Daylight Savings Time adjustment).
*           This only a concern in Posix where the specification of the TZ
*           environment restricts the combined offset for time zone and
*           Daylight Savings Time to 2 * (24:59:59), just under 50 hours.
*
*Entry:
*       __time64_t *ptime - pointer to a long time value
*
*Exit:
*       errno_t = 0 success
*                 tm members filled-in
*       errno_t = non zero
*                 tm members initialized to -1 if ptm != NULL
*
*Exceptions:
*       See items (3) and (4) in the NOTES above. If these assumptions are
*       violated, behavior is undefined.
