*       OS when a thread begins or ends.  On thread start, walk the list of
*       pointers to initialization routines for dynamically-initialized
*       __declspec(thread) variables.  On thread stop, walk the list of
*       destructors for __declspec(thread) variables, as registered at
*       initialization time.

 * and .CRT$XDZ similar to the way global static initializers are done
 * for C++.  The C++ compiler will inject function pointers into .CRT$XD[CLU]

 * __dyn_tls_init - dynamically initialize __declspec(thread) variables
 *
 * Purpose:
 *      When any thread starts up, walk the array of function pointers found
 *      in sections .CRT$XD*, calling each non-NULL entry to dynamically
 *      initialize that thread's copy of a __declspec(thread) variable.
 *
 * Entry:
 *      This is called directly from the Windows loader code, with dwReason
 *      equal to one of DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH/DETACH or DLL_THREAD_ATTACH_DETACH.
 *
 * Exit:
 *      Returns TRUE always, though the loader code ignores the result.
 *
 * Notes:
 *      Only calls the initializers on DLL_THREAD_ATTACH and not
 *      DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH.  That's because the DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH call happens
 *      too early, before the CRT has been initialized in, e.g.,
 *      DllMainCRTStartup or mainCRTStartup.  Instead, the CRT init code will
 *      call here directly with a DLL_THREAD_ATTACH to initialize any
 *      __declspec(thread) variables in the primary thread at process startup.
