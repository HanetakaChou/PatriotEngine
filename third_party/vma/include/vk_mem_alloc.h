This function works by moving allocations to different places (different
`VkDeviceMemory` objects and/or different offsets) in order to optimize memory
usage. Only allocations that are in `pAllocations` array can be moved. All other
allocations are considered nonmovable in this call. Basic rules:

- Only allocations made in memory types that have
  `VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT` and `VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT`
  flags can be compacted. You may pass other allocations but it makes no sense -
  these will never be moved.
- Custom pools created with #VMA_POOL_CREATE_LINEAR_ALGORITHM_BIT or
  #VMA_POOL_CREATE_BUDDY_ALGORITHM_BIT flag are not defragmented. Allocations
  passed to this function that come from such pools are ignored.
- Allocations created with #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_DEDICATED_MEMORY_BIT or
  created as dedicated allocations for any other reason are also ignored.
- Both allocations made with or without #VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_MAPPED_BIT
  flag can be compacted. If not persistently mapped, memory will be mapped
  temporarily inside this function if needed.
- You must not pass same #VmaAllocation object multiple times in `pAllocations` array.

The function also frees empty `VkDeviceMemory` blocks.

Warning: This function may be time-consuming, so you shouldn't call it too often
(like after every resource creation/destruction).
You can call it on special occasions (like when reloading a game level or
when you just destroyed a lot of objects). Calling it every frame may be OK, but
you should measure that on your platform.

Gets `VkDeviceMemory` handle and offset from the allocation.
If you want to create an image, allocate memory for it and bind them together separately,
you should use this function for binding instead of standard `vkBindImageMemory()`,
because it ensures proper synchronization so that when a `VkDeviceMemory` object is used by multiple
allocations, calls to `vkBind*Memory()` or `vkMapMemory()` won't happen from multiple threads simultaneously
(which is illegal in Vulkan).

/**
\param allocator
\param pBufferCreateInfo
\param pAllocationCreateInfo
\param[out] pBuffer Buffer that was created.
\param[out] pAllocation Allocation that was created.
\param[out] pAllocationInfo Optional. Information about allocated memory. It can be later fetched using function vmaGetAllocationInfo().

This function automatically:

-# Creates buffer.
-# Allocates appropriate memory for it.
-# Binds the buffer with the memory.

If any of these operations fail, buffer and allocation are not created,
returned value is negative error code, *pBuffer and *pAllocation are null.

If the function succeeded, you must destroy both buffer and allocation when you
no longer need them using either convenience function vmaDestroyBuffer() or
separately, using `vkDestroyBuffer()` and vmaFreeMemory().

If #VMA_ALLOCATOR_CREATE_KHR_DEDICATED_ALLOCATION_BIT flag was used,
VK_KHR_dedicated_allocation extension is used internally to query driver whether
it requires or prefers the new buffer to have dedicated allocation. If yes,
and if dedicated allocation is possible
(#VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_NEVER_ALLOCATE_BIT is not used), it creates dedicated
allocation for this buffer, just like when using
#VMA_ALLOCATION_CREATE_DEDICATED_MEMORY_BIT.

\note This function creates a new `VkBuffer`. Sub-allocation of parts of one large buffer,
although recommended as a good practice, is out of scope of this library and could be implemented
by the user as a higher-level logic on top of VMA.
