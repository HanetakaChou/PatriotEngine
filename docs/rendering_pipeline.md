#### Lebesgue Integral    

The mathematics courses of the Computer Science Major in college only involve the Riemann integrals. However, I think it is beneficial to learn the Lebesgue integrals which will bring you a deeper understand of the formulas in the Computer Graphics.    


#### Manifold   
The Steradian can be treated as the 2-Manifold which reduces the dimensions from 3(R^3) to 2(S^2) and simplifies the integral over the sphere surface when one calculates the lighting.
